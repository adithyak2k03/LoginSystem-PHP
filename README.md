# LoginSystem-PHP
A simple PHP-based authentication system using MVC architecture, with secure login, signup, and profile management via sessions and MySQL.


## Things I learned through this project

- Session Security Techniques: I learned the importance of using session security best practices to build a secure yet user-friendly login system. Balancing security and user convenience is crucial, as these factors often conflict, and finding the right balance is key.

- Hashing Techniques: I also learned importance of hashing and implemented general hashing and password hashing(inbuilt feature in php).
  
- MVC(Model, View and Controller) architecture: I learned how to separate the application logic into distinct layers—Model for data handling, View for user interface, and Controller for managing user input and interactions.

- PHP’s Extensive Built-in Functions: I explored the rich set of built-in functions in PHP, which greatly simplified backend tasks such as data validation, session management, and database interaction, allowing for faster and more efficient development.

## Future Works
User and Admin Login Functionality: In future iterations, I plan to implement role-based authentication to differentiate between regular users and admin users.
