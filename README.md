# LoginSystem-PHP
A simple PHP-based authentication system using MVC architecture, with secure login, signup, and profile management via sessions and MySQL.


## Things I learned through this project

- Session Security techniques that should be followed for a secure and user friendly login system. Security and User convienience often acts against each other, so we should find a fine balance between them.

- MVC(Model, View and Controller) architecture: I learned how to separate the application logic into distinct layersâ€”Model for data handling, View for user interface, and Controller for managing user input and interactions.

- Extensive libraries of inbuilt fucntions of PHP language and PHP for backend purposes.
